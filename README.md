# EncodeTests

I've doing some tests of transcoding videos with multiple codecs, encoders, and options.

Here's the results, comparing speed, quality, size, etc among various parameters.

Test is run via [FFmpegScripts](https://github.com/awidesky/FFmpegScripts) project, and result is organized in spreadsheets.



I'm not an expert in ffmpeg, so if you have any tip for improvements in test script or metrix, please let me know.
